# wpQuizFlow JavaScript Assets

This directory contains the React-based frontend components for wpQuizFlow.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development (watch mode)
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build
```

## Structure

- **`components/`** - React component source files
- **`dist/`** - Built/minified files (generated by webpack)
- **`quiz-app.js`** - Main app initialization entry point
- **`webpack.config.js`** - Build configuration
- **`package.json`** - Dependencies and scripts

## Building

All `.jsx` files must be built before they can be used. The build process:

1. Transpiles JSX to JavaScript using Babel
2. Bundles React and all components together
3. Minifies for production
4. Generates source maps for debugging

See [BUILD.md](./BUILD.md) for detailed documentation.

## Development

1. Make changes to `.jsx` files
2. Run `npm run dev` (auto-rebuilds on save)
3. Hard refresh browser to see changes

## Production

1. Run `npm run build`
2. Commit the `dist/` files to version control
3. Deploy to production

**Note:** The `dist/` directory should be committed to version control so that the plugin works without requiring npm/node.js on the production server.
