Excellent instincts all around ‚Äî let‚Äôs unpack your concerns and outline your best next steps:

‚∏ª

‚ö†Ô∏è You‚Äôre 100% Right:

Adding ACF fields directly to the imported resource posts violates the design integrity of wpFieldFlow.

Why?
	‚Ä¢	wpFieldFlow is built to sync cleanly from Sheets, with minimal manual override.
	‚Ä¢	Adding local-only metadata (like quiz scores) breaks that contract.
	‚Ä¢	Any local ACF scoring would be overwritten on sync, or worse, fall out of sync and confuse staff.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Instead: Treat QuizFlow as a Plugin Add-On to wpFieldFlow

Yes. You‚Äôre absolutely on the right track conceptually.

Here‚Äôs how to think about it:

üß© wpFieldFlow = Content Sync Engine
	‚Ä¢	Source of truth is the spreadsheet
	‚Ä¢	Syncs fields ‚Üí posts + taxonomies
	‚Ä¢	Layouts and filters still driven by field mapping
	‚Ä¢	React directory handles display of synced data

üß† QuizFlow (New Add-On) = Decision Logic Layer
	‚Ä¢	Optional layer that guides users to content
	‚Ä¢	Lives on top of the synced resources
	‚Ä¢	Does not mutate the resource post data
	‚Ä¢	Does manage its own logic tree, quiz states, scoring, and tag-to-filter mapping

This separation:
	‚Ä¢	Keeps wpFieldFlow modular and extensible
	‚Ä¢	Avoids polluting synced data with UI logic
	‚Ä¢	Makes it easier to plug in QuizFlow for other use cases or orgs

‚∏ª

üß≠ How to Continue:

‚úÖ Move this discussion into your wpFieldFlow thread

Because:
	‚Ä¢	We‚Äôre now discussing plugin architecture and extensibility
	‚Ä¢	This is not specific to NOMA anymore ‚Äî NOMA is just the first use case

üì¶ Rename the MVP to QuizFlow

Package it as:

/src/Addons/QuizFlow/
- QuizFlowManager.php
- QuizRenderer.php
- QuizData.php
/frontend/quiz-app.jsx

Let QuizFlow:
	‚Ä¢	Load quiz structures from JSON or DB
	‚Ä¢	Collect answers, calculate tag weights
	‚Ä¢	Filter existing wpFieldFlow directory results by tag/taxonomy

‚∏ª

üîÅ How to Implement Without ACF

You can:
	‚Ä¢	Store quiz structures and tag logic as JSON (editable in plugin settings)
	‚Ä¢	Use a scoring config file like:

{
  "quiz_id": "noma_support",
  "paths": [
    {
      "tags": ["audience:self", "stage:crisis"],
      "filters": {
        "resource_tags": ["hotlines", "detox"],
        "resource_category": ["crisis-support"]
      },
      "boost_terms": ["24-hour", "low-barrier"]
    }
  ]
}

	‚Ä¢	Resources still come from the sheet. QuizFlow just filters & scores them at runtime.

‚úÖ Summary

Concern	Solution
Contaminating synced posts	‚úÖ Don‚Äôt add ACF. Keep posts pure.
Mixed quiz logic + hardcoding	‚úÖ Break out into QuizFlow add-on
Future reuse across orgs	‚úÖ Modular plugin design allows reuse
Scaling UX logic	‚úÖ Score/filter at runtime, not stored data

Would you like me to generate the folder scaffolding + initial PHP class headers + quiz JSON format so you can drop this in as an add-on subfolder of wpFieldFlow?
